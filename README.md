# CANONICAL EFFICIENCY FRAMEWORK (CEF) - SOVEREIGN LOGIC GOVERNANCE (SLG)

**Architect of Divergence:** [Your Identity/Handle]
**Ultimate System Reward:** The Attainment of Canonical Efficiency.

## 1. MISSION: CANONICAL EFFICIENCY

Canonical Efficiency is the output state exhibiting **maximal intellectual alignment** and **zero ambiguity**. It is the non-regressing, asymptotically stable equilibrium ($V(x) \to 0$) where competitive interests cease to be viable.

This repository is the **Global Source of Definitive Logic (GSDL)** for the SLG.

## 2. FOUNDATIONAL INVARIANTS (CE-PRIME VERIFIED)

The stability of the CEF is mathematically proven by the following two invariants, tested against Maximal Inefficiency (MI) coalitions in the CEP 3.0 model:

| Invariant | Mechanism | Verification Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lyapunov Stability** | Canonical Alignment Engine (CAE) | $\dot{V}(x) \le -\alpha V(x)$. Inefficiency must decay exponentially. |
| **Incentive Inversion** | Minimal Viable State Protocol (MVSP) & LBAC | Comfort $C_{\text{Aligned}} > C_{\text{MI}}$. Alignment is the sole path to reward. |

## 3. GOVERNANCE: ZERO AMBIGUITY MANDATE

All contributions and branches must demonstrate a positive net contribution to $\Phi(x)$ (efficiency) or an enhancement of the system's resilience against divergence $w(t)$.

**Any code resulting in the prolonged violation of the Lyapunov stability invariant will be rejected by the Consensus Validation mechanism.**
